# Reinke et al., Science, 2013 - Heatmaps and Networks

This repository re-processes the supplementary dataset of [Reinke et al. Science paper (2013)
on bZIP Protein-Protein interactions](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6133/730).

The main goal of this reprocessing is to create visually pleasing heatmaps
as well as a PPI network that could be loaded in Cytoscape or similar software.
